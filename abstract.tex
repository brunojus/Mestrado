In this work, a proposal is made for a multicamera system for object detection, as well as distance measurement through computer vision. The performance of other techniques is evaluated to take into account the best result of the proposed framework. Once the algorithms have been implemented, there are several other scenarios and characteristics that can be taken into account for a possible distance measurement error, most of the time this error is directly related to meteorological factors and also to a weak communication signal between cameras and the control hardware. Through the results obtained, it is noticed that in ideal conditions and in controlled environments, the methods of object detection guarantee satisfactory precision, with an accuracy above 93 \%, but when there is another object in front of it, the accuracy drastically reduces . To reduce these problems, it was proposed to optimize the positioning of the cameras, as well as the angle of inclination.
