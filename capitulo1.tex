\chapter{Introduction} \label{introducao}
In this chapter the problem statement will be defined. 
\section{Motivation}

The autonomous vehicles are the new reality for the next years with this premise, the new solutions need to grow, and one of these important necessity is the vehicle tracking. Given that, there are many levels of self-drive car automation as shown in Figure \ref{fig:automation}. This work is focused on test scenario of level 5 of driving automation. Due to drones requires many battery during the test and limits the scenario to 30 to 45 minutes, the proposal is to use the infrastructere along the road as camera on the pole and send the data to a command central.

\section{Problem Description}

The problematic of this theme is to create an architecture to detect objects along the roads combined with the distance of these along the road. The first approach could be using a drone, but due to the battery conditions for a long tests it is not a good choice. Figure \ref{fig:tests} shown this problem. The goal is to track the position of the cars even vehicle under the test (VUT) and traffic simulation data (TSV) along the road and send this information to the command central (CC).

\section{Objectives}

Create a framework able to detect objects as cars, trucks, motorcycles, pedestrians and other strange obstacles along the road, and with these capacities estimate the distance of this object along the road, this framework is necessary to work with a camera array.

\section{Chapters Description}

This work is divides as follow as: in Chapter 2, the state of the art will be presented, with the goal to support this work, once it is necessary to get a good part of the previous contributions in this research area. In Chapter 3, the theoretical concepts to support the understanding of this work will be presented, since self-drive cars is new trend topic is necessary to describe step by step about this necessary to provide a good theoretical background. In Chapter 4, the proposed framework is shown and the mathematical modelling is provided. In Chapter 5, the results will be discussed around the algorithm performance and the error for object detection position estimation. Finally, in Chapter 6, the conclusions will be discussed regarding the experiments, and some future works will be shown.
