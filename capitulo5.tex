\section{Validation}

For validation purpose, it was used a commercial laser measurement as shown in Figure \ref{fig:laser_meas}, this model is known as Bosch DLE 40 Professional $^{\tiny{\textregistered}}$.

\end{figure}

The instrumental error rate is $\pm 1.5 mm$, thereby we repeated the measure three times and computed the mean, and standard deviation as well. In Table \ref{tab:tab_measure} is shown the measurements with the camera positioned at $2.01$ m from the ground. And in Figure \ref{fig:park} is shown the position of the cars along the parking lot.

The algorithm for object detection was performed over the parking lot of the company EFS GmbH as shown in Figure \ref{fig:park}.

The algorithm of the proposed framework predict the objects of the whole scenario in 28 ms and has identified 9 cars on the image as show in Figure \ref{fig:park_predict} and in Table \ref{tab:accuracy} is shown the accuracy of each prediction for each car.
