\section{Validation}

For validation purpose, it was used a commercial laser measurement as shown in Figure \ref{fig:laser_meas}, this model is known as Bosch DLE 40 Professional $^{\tiny{\textregistered}}$.

The instrumental error rate is $\pm 1.5 mm$, thereby we repeated the measure three times and computed the mean, and standard deviation as well. In Table \ref{tab:tab_measure} is shown the measurements with the camera positioned at $2.01$ m from the ground. And in the Figure \ref{fig:park} is shown the position of the cars along the parking lot.
